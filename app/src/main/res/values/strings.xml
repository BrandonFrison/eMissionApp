    <string name="about_text_1">
    As Canadians, we often think of ourselves as surrounded by nature and thoughtful about the environment.
    Indeed, Vancouver has spearheaded the Greenest City Action Plan since 2011, with the goal of becoming the greenest city in the world by 2020.
    Of the plan’s 10 specific goals, and one of the goals is for a lighter footprint, reducing Vancouver\'s carbon footprint by 33% over 2006 levels.\n</string>
    <string name="about_text_header1">What is a carbon footprint\n</string>
    <string name="about_text_2">
    Greenhouse gases, measured in CO2e (CO2 equivalents), are known to directly contribute to climate change, and include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.
    In 2015, regional emissions in Metro Vancouver were projected to be 14.9 million tonnes of CO2e, between 6-8 tonnes per capita.
    In other words, we can then say that our personal carbon footprint is about 6-8 tonnes of CO2e.
    However, it is generally estimated that global emissions must be reduced to approximately 2 tonnes per capita by 2050.\n</string>
    <string name="about_text_header2">What contributes to greenhouse gases\n</string>
    <string name="about_text_3">
    There are many CO2e contributors to our carbon footprint, including transportation and buildings (commercial, residential).
    Municipalities and businesses are currently 2 undertaking measures to reduce their footprints.
    For example, Metro Vancouver transit can be promoted over cars, and buildings are changing their heating systems from natural gas to hydroelectric.\n
    \n
    Despite these efforts at the governmental level, at the current pace of change, it is unlikely we will meet the 2020 target.
    What else can we do to mitigate climate change? Aside from 3 taking transit, is there anything else we can do as individuals?\n</string>
    <string name="about_text_header3">The carbon impact of food\n</string>
    <string name="about_text_4">
    Food is generally under-reported as a source of CO2e. For instance, in Europe, agriculture contributes to 10% of the carbon footprint.
    In particular, ruminants such as sheep and cows produce methane through enteric fermentation (i.e. they pass gas) and produce more CO2e than other types of animals.
    According to the European Commission, the vast majority of methane emissions (85%) come from ruminants’ digestion. Certain foods take more CO2e to produce than others.\n</string>
    <string name="about_text_header4">A Low Carbon Diet\n</string>
    <string name="about_text_5">
    There are 2.46 million people living in the Metro Vancouver area, and about 90% of them eat food that are relatively high in CO2e (i.e., are non-vegetarian).
    If each of those people, for instance, reduced beef/lamb from 35% to 10% and instead ate chicken, Vancouver could save 900,000 to 1 million tonnes of CO2e per year.\n</string>
